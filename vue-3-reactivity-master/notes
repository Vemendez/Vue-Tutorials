Vue2
This was called like this refering to dependig on an owner to execute a code, and then notifying it
to save the effect = depend()
to run = notify()

Needed to create a dep class


Vue3
Changin it verbs to track meaning tracking the efect and trigger to trigger it
to save the effect = track()
to run = trigger()

just need to call set to simplify perfomance
